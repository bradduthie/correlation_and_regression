SPSS_spearman_output.png:

SPSS output of Spearman's rank correlation test between the variables Pct_O2 and Ammonia. The correlation is -0.667 and the significance value is shown as 0.071.


SPSS_spearman_test.png:

SPSS data showing two columns (Pct_O2 and Ammonia). A 'Bivariate Correlations' box is open with the Variables Pct_O2 and Ammonia placed in the 'Variables' box, the 'Spearman' checkbox checked, and 'Two-tailed' Test of Significance radio button selected.

normality_test.png:

SPSS boxes showing a test for normality with 'Soild_Depth' and 'Root_Density' in the Dependent List boxes. A second window "Explore: Plots" is also open with the checkbox 'Normality plots with tests' selected.

normality_test_table.png:

SPSS output showing Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Shapiro-Wilk tests of normality for the variables 'Soil_Depth' and 'Root_Density'. The value 'Sig.' is 0.2 for both variables in the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. The 'Sig.' value for Soil_Depth is 0.960, and the value for Root_Density is 0.407.

SPSS_corr_output.png:

Output for a test of correlation significance between 'Soil_Depth' and 'Root_Density'. The 'Pearson Correlation' is listed as -0.843 with two asterisks in superscript. The value of 'Sig. (2-tailed) is 0.002.

SPSS_corr_test.png:

SPSS boxes for a Pearson correlation test with the 'Bivariate Correlations' window open and 'Soil_Depth' and 'Root_Density' in the Variables box. A 'Pearson' Correlation Coefficient is checked, and the radio button below indicates a 'Two-tailed' Test of Significance.


SPSS_scatter.png:

A scatterplot produced in SPSS that shows Soil_Depth on the x-axis and Root_Density on the y-axis. The 10 data points on the plot show a clear negative trend.

cor_eg.png:

A figure with eight separate panels (2 columns and 4 rows), each of which shows a scatter plot with a different correlation coefficient. Correlation coefficients shown include r = 0.2, 0.4, 0.7, 1.0, -0.2, -0.4, -0.7, and -1.0.

no_cor.png:

A scatterplot showing 'X value' on the x axis and 'Y value' on the y axis. Many points are shown but there is no correlation between variables.

pos_neg_cor.png:

A plot with two panels, each showing a scatterplot with 'X value' on the x-axis and 'Y value' on the y-axis. The left plot shows points positively correlated, and the right plot shows points negatively correlated.

generic_regression.png:

A scatterplot showing 'X value' on the x axis and 'Y value' on the y axis. A line of best fit runs through all of the points.

labelled_regression.png:

A scatterplot showing 'X value' on the x axis and 'Y value' on the y axis. A line of best fit runs through all of the points. The regression equation line is written in the upper left of the plot. The 'Slope (b)' is indicated, and is the 'Intercept (a)' and a 'Residual' value.


heteroscedasticity.png:

A scatterplot showing 'X value' on the x axis and 'Y value' on the y axis. A line of best fit runs through all of the points. The variance of points around the regression line increases with an increase in x, showing clear heteroscedasticity.

rsquared_expl.png:

A scatterplot showing 'X value' on the x axis and 'Y value' on the y axis. A blue line of best fit runs through all of the points. A red horizontal dashed line shows where the mean of y is located. Vertical blue lines connect data points with the blue line of best fit, and vertical red dotted lines connect data poitns with the red horizontal dashed line.

rsquared_vals.png:

Four panels showing scatterplots with coefficient of determination values equaling 0.04 (upper left), 0.16 (upper right), 0.49 (lower left), and 1 (lower right).

resid_hist.png:

SPSS output showing a histogram of the residual values of a model. The histogram appears bimodal.


wt_vs_mpg:

SPSS output showing a scatterplot with 'wt' on the x-axis and 'mpg' on the y-axis. There is a clear negative trend in the data.



linear_regression_spss.png:

SPSS boxes showing 'mpg' as depednent and 'wt' as indpendent variables in a linear regression. A second window is open with 'Histogram' and 'Normal probability plot' selected.


SPSS_regression_output.png:

SPSS output including four tables; (1) variables entered or removed, (2) model summary, (3) ANOVA, and (4) Coefficients.


Coefficients.png:

Table showing SPSS regression output for model coefficients, which show two variables (Const) and wt with estimates at 37.28 and -11.785, respectively. Both variables are significant (Sig. = .000).

ANOVA.png:

Table showing SPSS regression output for ANOVA, which shows an F value of 91.388 and a significance of .000.


SPSS_model_summary:

Table showing SPSS regression output for a model summary that includes an R square value of 0.753.


SPSS_regression_residuals.png

A histogram showing 'Regression Standardised Residual' on the x-axis and 'Frequency' on the y-axis. Histogram bars are roughly normally distributed. A smooth normal distribution curve is overlaying them.
